## Repositories Structure

The [`TMA Framework`](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework) will follow an adaption of the `MAPE-K` concepts. 
Therefore, a repository structure was defined that is based on [this repository](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework), which contains the general information of the framework, including architecture and design information.
It also acts as the umbrella repository for 5 other repositories that map with each of the main components of the of the `MAPE-K` loop, as follows:
* [**M**onitor](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-m)
* [**A**nalyze](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-a)
* [**P**lanning](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-p)
* [**E**xecute](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-e)
* [**K**nowledge](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-k)

Each repository maintains its own issues and projects, while the [umbrella project](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework) only manages general issues that affect more than one component.
