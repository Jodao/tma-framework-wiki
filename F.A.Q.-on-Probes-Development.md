tbc a simple intro.

## How does these probe's thing work?
To be explained.
Mention the Tasks of WP4, WP5 and Wp6.

## How can I create my own probe
Instructions to create a probe in `Java` are [provided here](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-m/tree/master/development/libraries/monitor-client).
A demo probe showing the key features is [available here](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-m/tree/master/development/probes)
Further details will be added soon in both cases.

## What will be the languages supported
The monitor provides a REST API, therefore probes can be developed in any language.
We plan provide supporting libraries to make it easier to develop probes in `Java` and `Python`.
