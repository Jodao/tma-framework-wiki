Trustworthiness Monitoring & Assessment (TMA) Framework is a platform that is responsible to design and implement the trustworthiness monitoring and assessment solution for the [ATMOSPHERE](https://www.atmosphere-eubrazil.eu/) ecosystem.


## Components
The [`TMA Framework`](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework) will follow an adaption of the `MAPE-K` concepts. Therefore, this platform is composed by 5 components:
* [TMA_Monitor](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-m) - This component provides a generic interface that can be acessed by the probes installed in the different layers of the system to send data about the collected measurements and events.
* [TMA_Knowledge] (https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-k) - This component is responsible for the storage of data collected by probes and validated by TMA_Monitor. 
* [TMA_Planning] (https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/tma-framework-p) - This component is responsible
